## Usage
You can use the -i flag to open a interactive shell after executing a file. In our case, we create all methods for further usage.
```py
$ python3 -i KI.py
>>> ...
>>> perceptronLearn([1,0,1,1],[0.2,0.7,0.9,-0.7],0)
```

Alternativly you can import the functions
```py
$ python3
>>> from KI import *
>>> ...
>>> perceptronLearn([1,0,1,1],[0.2,0.7,0.9,-0.7],0)
```
